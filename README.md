## Methodology

### Data Collection

The study uses Amazon review data to analyze customer sentiment and its impact on retail business strategies. Data collection involves gathering customer reviews from public databases and social media platforms.

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and normalizing categorical variables to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Four machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Analysis

The study found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 96.15%. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis provided granular insights into specific attributes like product quality, shipping, and customer service, offering a deeper understanding of customer feedback.
